# FlowProcessor Packaging and Build Updates

## Summary

Updated the FlowProcessor project packaging and build system to support production builds without tests, following modern packaging standards and user preferences for no backwards compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `pyproject.toml`

- **Added production build configuration** with setuptools settings
- **Excluded test files** from distribution packages
- **Added package data configuration** for resources
- **Maintained modern packaging** with no setup.py dependency

### 2. Updated Build Scripts

#### `scripts/build_package.sh`
- **Removed test dependencies** and pytest integration
- **Added basic quality checks** (ruff, mypy) without tests
- **Updated messaging** to indicate production builds
- **Maintained interactive prompts** for user control

#### `scripts/build_pyinstaller.sh`
- **Removed test dependencies** and pytest integration
- **Added basic quality checks** without tests
- **Updated command line options** (`--no-checks` instead of `--no-tests`)
- **Updated messaging** to indicate production builds

#### `scripts/build_production.sh` (NEW)
- **Created dedicated production build script**
- **Fast builds** without tests or test dependencies
- **Production-only dependency installation**
- **Streamlined workflow** for production releases

### 3. Updated Makefile

#### New Production Build Targets
- `build-prod` - Full production build with basic checks
- `build-prod-quick` - Quick production build (no checks)
- `build-prod-wheel` - Production wheel distribution
- `build-prod-sdist` - Production source distribution
- `pyinstaller-prod` - Production PyInstaller executable

#### Updated Help Documentation
- Added production build section to help output
- Updated examples to include new commands
- Clear distinction between development and production builds

## Usage

### Production Package Builds
```bash
# Full production build with basic checks
make build-prod

# Quick production build (fastest)
make build-prod-quick

# Individual distribution formats
make build-prod-wheel
make build-prod-sdist
```

### Production Executable Builds
```bash
# Production PyInstaller build
make pyinstaller-prod

# Or use the script directly
./scripts/build_pyinstaller.sh --no-checks
```

### Direct Script Usage
```bash
# Production package build
./scripts/build_production.sh

# Production PyInstaller build
./scripts/build_pyinstaller.sh --no-checks
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Builds** - No test execution or test dependency installation
2. **Cleaner Packages** - Test files excluded from distribution
3. **Production Focused** - Dedicated workflows for production releases
4. **Modern Packaging** - Uses pyproject.toml exclusively
5. **Flexible Options** - Multiple build levels from quick to full checks

## File Structure

```

├── pyproject.toml              # Updated with production config
├── Makefile                    # Added production build targets

```

## Testing Results

✅ **Package Build**: Successfully built wheel and source distributions
✅ **PyInstaller Build**: Successfully created standalone executable and macOS app bundle
✅ **Installation Test**: Package installs and imports correctly
✅ **Quick Build**: Fast production builds work as expected

## Notes

- Test files are excluded from distribution packages
- Production builds skip test execution for faster builds
- Maintains compatibility with existing development workflows
- Follows user preferences for modern packaging only
- No backwards compatibility support added
