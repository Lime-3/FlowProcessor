## 🚀 Recommended Usage

### For Daily Use:
```bash
# Start with a quick check
./debug.sh quick

# Launch the application normally
python -m flowproc
```

### For Troubleshooting:
```bash
# If you encounter issues
./debug.sh health      # Check system health
./debug.sh monitor     # Run with monitoring
./debug.sh logs        # Check recent logs
```

### For Performance Monitoring:
```bash
# Monitor during long processing sessions
./debug.sh monitor     # Real-time monitoring
```

## 📋 Key Log Files

1. **`flowproc/data/logs/processing.log`** (2.0MB)
   - Main application logs
   - Contains all processing events
   - Shows file operations and errors

2. **`debug.log`** (created when using monitor)
   - Enhanced debugging information
   - Performance metrics
   - Real-time monitoring data

## 🎯 Performance Expectations

**Normal Operation:**
- Memory usage: 50-200MB
- CPU usage: 5-30% during processing
- Startup time: 2-5 seconds
- File processing: 1-10 seconds per CSV

**Your System Performance:**
- ✅ Memory usage within normal range
- ✅ CPU usage efficient
- ✅ Processing speed good
- ✅ No performance bottlenecks detected

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Quick Fix | Debug Command |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| App won't start | Check venv activation | `./debug.sh quick` |
| Slow performance | Monitor resources | `./debug.sh monitor` |
| File processing errors | Check logs | `./debug.sh logs` |
| Memory issues | Restart application | `./debug.sh status` |
| GUI problems | Check display settings | `./debug.sh health` |

## 📈 Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Before Starting Work:**
   ```bash
   ./debug.sh quick
   ```

2. **During Long Sessions:**
   ```bash
   ./debug.sh monitor
   ```

3. **If Issues Arise:**
   ```bash
   ./debug.sh health
   ./debug.sh logs
   ```

4. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Check log file sizes monthly
   - Restart application every few hours for long sessions
   - Monitor memory usage during large file processing
