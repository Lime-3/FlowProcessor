## Detailed Test Results

### 1. CSV Loading Tests ‚úÖ
- **Result**: All 14 files loaded successfully
- **Details**: All CSV files were successfully read using pandas
- **File sizes**: Range from 3.1 KB to 9.4 KB
- **Data complexity**: Files contained 14-21 columns and 20-72 rows

### 2. FlowProcessor Parsing Tests ‚úÖ
- **Result**: All 14 files parsed successfully
- **Sample ID Detection**: All files had identifiable sample ID columns
- **Data Structure**: Successfully extracted groups, animals, tissues, and time points
- **Compensation Specimens**: System correctly handled compensation specimen rows (warnings expected)

### 3. Sample ID Extraction Tests ‚úÖ
- **Result**: 13/14 files had extractable sample IDs (93% success rate)
- **Success Cases**: Most files contained well-formatted sample IDs
- **Edge Case**: AS263_GFP Table.csv had compensation specimens that couldn't be parsed as sample IDs (expected behavior)

- **Time Course Data**: Successfully identified time points in relevant files

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Robust CSV Handling**: Successfully processes various CSV formats and sizes
2. **Flexible Parsing**: Handles different sample ID formats and naming conventions
3. **Data Validation**: Correctly identifies and validates data structures
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles edge cases like compensation specimens
5. **Export Functionality**: Successfully exports processed data to Excel format

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
1. **Visualization**: Some metric names are too long for the visualization system
